# MonkeyPox-Cases-in-EU


# Project Name
Changes in the Number of MonkeyPox Cases in EE/EEA (May, June, July of 2022)
#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to explore trends in the numbers of MonkeyPox cases in Europe. 

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Tableau 
* You can view my dashboard [on my Tableau public account]( https://public.tableau.com/views/NumberofMonkeyPoxCasesinEuropeandPopulationCountforeachCountryMay2022toJuly2022/MonleypoxCasesintheEUEEA?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Project Description

*The goal of this project is to explore trends in MonkeyPox cases in the Countries of the European Union.

* Two Datasets used in this project. [Dataset 1]( https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps00001/default/table?lang=en): Population of the European Countries that I am studying. [Dataset 2]( https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/data-monkeypox-cases-eueea): Number of Monkeypox Cases in the EU/EEA for the months of May, June, and July of 2022. 

* I combined my two datasets using relationship btween the two datasets

* I explored MonkeyPox cases for each country. 

* I Categorized MonkeyPox Cases into five categories for better visualization. 

* I created butterfly chart to show number of cases and population for each country. 

* Incidence rate per 100,000 population was calculated. 
 
* Pages: Dates (Months of May, June, and July). You can view number of cases for each month using Dates panel. 

* Map shows name of the country, number of cases, and population count. Hover over the map to display additional information such as Rank of the confirmed cases (Descending), and month 

## Observations:
* Fewer cases of MonkeyPox reported in May 2022 comaring to June and July of the same year
*  Spain had the highest incidence rate: 5.22 per 100,000 population
* Slovakia had the lowest incidence rate: 0.02 per 100,000 population
