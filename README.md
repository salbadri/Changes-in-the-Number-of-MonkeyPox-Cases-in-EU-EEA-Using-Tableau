## Project Description

*The goal of this project is to explore trends in MonkeyPox cases in the Countries of the European Union.

* Two Datasets used in this project. [Dataset 1]( https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps00001/default/table?lang=en): Population of the European Countries that I am studying. [Dataset 2]( https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/data-monkeypox-cases-eueea): Number of Monkeypox Cases in the EU/EEA for the months of May, June, and July of 2022. 

* I combined my two datasets using relationship btween the two datasets

* I explored MonkeyPox cases cross countries. 

* I Categorized MonkeyPox Cases into five categories for better visualization. 

* I created butterfly chart to show number of cases and population for each country. 

* Incidence rate per 100,000 population was calculated. 
 
* Pages: Dates (Months of May, June, and July). You can view number of cases for each month using Dates panel. 

* Map shows name of the country, number of cases, and population count. Hover over the map to display additional information such as Rank of the confirmed cases (Descending), and month
